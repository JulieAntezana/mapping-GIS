A repository for GIS Mapping projects

# Overview

I am creating a GIS Mapping project to further my learning as a software engineer.

This software is a map of Washington, D.C. It has four feature layers: 1. The D.C. boundaries, 2. D.C. Waterbodies, 3. Several points of interest for enjoying a Cherry Blossom Tour, and 4. A few points of interest for a bike tour. Items on all layers can be clicked to get further information, including links to photos.

My purpose for writing this software was to encourage tourism in Washington, D.C. I hope it will help others who may be planning to travel to the Washington, D.C. area during late March or early April when the cherry blossoms are blooming around the Tidal Basin.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
